# Welcome to my blog

This is the first post on my new blog system. It is written in **Obsidian** and automatically deployed to my website.

## How it works

1. I write in Obsidian.
2. I push to GitHub.
3. Cloudflare builds the site.

### Code Example

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

Enjoy!
